				<h1>Skills to pay the bills</h1>
				<p>It is tough to 'show off' your abilities as a developer. I could list all the languages I've worked with but that doesn't quite paint the whole picture. I've decided that actively challenging myself by taking courses online has made me a better developer but also given me a way to prove my knowledge. The badges may seem limited but they are growing on weekly basis. Keep checking back to see what else I've completed!</p>
